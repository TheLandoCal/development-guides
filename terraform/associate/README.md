## Sample Questions

While HashiCorp provides a handful of sample questions, it is no where near enough to get a real feel for the true exam or to evaluate gaps in your Terraform knowledge. Here you'll find the official sample questions as well as questions created from the documentation that mirror the sample questions (constructed) mapped to the exam objectives (from [HashiCorp Learn](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/associate-review?in=terraform/certification#review-guide)).

- [ ] Add real questions after taking the exam

### 8: Read, generate, and modify configuration

#### 8a: Demonstrate use of variables and outputs

1.  Consider the following Terraform 0.12 configuration snippet:

    ```go
     variable "vpc_cidrs" {
         type = map
         default = {
             us-east-1 = "10.0.0.0/16"
             us-east-2 = "10.1.0.0/16"
             us-west-1 = "10.2.0.0/16"
             us-west-2 = "10.3.0.0/16"
         }
     }

     resource "aws_vpc" "shared" {
         cidr_block = _____________
     }

    ```

    How would you define the `cidr_block` for us-east-1 in the `aws_vpc` resource using a variable?

    - `var.vpc_cidrs["us-east-1"]`
    - `var.vpc_cidrs.0`
    - `vpc_cidrs["us-east-1"]`
    - `var.vpc_cidrs[0]`

    <summary>Answer</summary>

    **`var.vpc_cidrs["us-east-1"]`**
